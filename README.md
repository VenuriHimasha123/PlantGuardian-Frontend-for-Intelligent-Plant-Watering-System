# Intelligent Plant Watering: A Sensor-Driven System for Sri Lanka Green Thumbs

## Project Overview
The **Intelligent Plant Watering** system is designed to optimize plant care and irrigation in Sri Lanka. By utilizing sensors to measure environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, the system automatically manages plant watering. The web-based monitoring platform allows users to view real-time data and receive notifications to help them maintain healthy plants.

## Project Development
The project uses a combination of Arduino sensors and a web-based frontend to monitor and automate plant care. The frontend was developed by **Behan Ravishka** and myself. We used the following technologies to build the system:

### Frontend:
- **HTML (60%)**: Provides the basic structure of the web platform, including areas to display temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data, as well as interactive elements like buttons and graphs.
- **CSS (30%)**: Ensures the user interface is clean, responsive, and visually appealing, creating an optimal experience across devices.
- **JavaScript (10%)**: Adds interactivity, including dynamic data updates, charting, and real-time sensor data visualizations.

### Backend:
- **PHP**: For server-side scripting and database management, ensuring the data sent from the Arduino sensors is properly stored and displayed on the user interface.

## Key Features:
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays live data for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- **Graphs**: Graphs visualize sensor data, showing the levels of humidity, temperature, and soil moisture over time.
- **Web-Based Interface**: The platform can be accessed remotely via any web browser to monitor plant health and irrigation status.
- **Automated Irrigation Control**: The system can trigger watering actions based on real-time data from the sensors.

## Technologies Used:
- **Arduino**: For sensor integration and data collection (measuring soil moisture, temperature, and humidity).
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: To create a user-friendly, interactive frontend for monitoring the data.
- **PHP**: Backend development for managing data flow and interactions between the sensors and frontend.
- **MySQL**: For storing and managing sensor data.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Mobile App Integration**: A dedicated app for monitoring and controlling the system from mobile devices.
- **Additional Sensors**: Future versions may include additional environmental sensors, such as light or pH sensors, to enhance plant care.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integration of machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics based on environmental data.
